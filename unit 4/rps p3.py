#Please make a new document called rps.py and Develop ideas and 
# analyze the requirements for a rock, paper, scissor game. 

# For the ideation phase, write down 3 things your rock, paper, 
# scissor game should be able to do

"1. Player should be able to pick from 3 options; rock, paper, and scissors."

"2. Player can player against the computer or another player."

"3. program needs to be able to understand which options win, lose or tie against"
"another option"

"4. If two player select the same option- draw, they have to play again."
"keep count of points."

"5. adding power ups"

# For the requirements and analysis phase, write down at last 4 
# technical requirements; example: be able to use integer data type 
# to process decisions.

# requirements- contexualize it in programming terms
# - what data types do we need
# - what operators do we need
# - are we using if/else
# - are we using a loop

"we need to assign some data to variables that will represent"
"rock, papper, and scissor."
"1"

"we can use strings to represent the rock, paper, and scissor"
"We can use integers to keep score."
"1"

"we need a conditional statement (if/else) to allow players to choose between"
"playing a human and a cpu; if user types h they can play a human, else they"
"will play the cpu."
"2"

"we need a for loop to keep the game running until someone wins."
"3.5"

"we can use comparion operators to determine if a selection is the same or not the same"
"1"

"powers ???"
"5"

# design - what should user be doing in our game, step-by-step
'1. Show player the start screen. start screen should have title (image), new game, continue, game rules, settings, quit'
'2. if the player hits start game, the player can choose between 1(cpu) or 2 players'
'3. if 2 players ...'
'4. if 1 player. they play the cpu'
'5. inform player the game has started and to make a selection; r,p,s '
'6. after player chooses an option, cpu randomly selects an option. '
"7. determine who wins, loses,or ties, inform the user, and distribute points"
"8. loop these actions 4 times. The player with the highest point wins."
"9. inform the user if they won or loss, show them the final score and give them"
"the option to play again or quite."
