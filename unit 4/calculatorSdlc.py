# Use the SDLC steps we learned to build a simple calculator app. 

# Ideate- what are some features we can
# Implement into our calculator?

'1. User should be able to input and calculate numbers.'

'2. Users should be able to create different'
'types of graphs (bar chart, scatter plot, etc.)'

'3. convert imperial units into metric units'

# Analysis and requirements- based on 
# The code concepts we’ve learned, how 
# Can we make are ideas more tangible in code.
#- what data types do we need?
#- what operators should we use?
#- do we need to use conditionals? or loops? or both?

'1. We will need to use the integer and float data type to represent '
'our number values'
'we can use input to pass in the data types into our program. we can use the '
'arithmatic operators to do our calculations.' 
# 1/5

'2. we could use the comparison operators to make some of our graphing logic.'
' we can install another python library to do the graphs for us.'
# 4/5

'3. we need to have the metric unit stored in a variable and then, do some'
' arithmatic operation to convert the number and get the result'
# 2.5/5

# example
inch=  1
foot= 12 # roughly 3ft in 1 meter
meter= 39.3701
