# Question 1
# Create a function that will check if a user is old enough to
# vote. Your function should take in the user's age as a parameter.
# If the user is old enough to vote, they should get a message telling them
# they can vote. Otherwise, it should tell the user they are not old enough.
# HINT = The age to vote is 18.

# Question 2

# should then be able to determine which number is the largest. Please 
# enter your numbers using the input function. 
# HINT =  You will need to use the max() function. 
# Read more about this on w3schools    

# Question 3
# Create a movie ticket function that gives user ticket prices based on their 
# age. Your function should take in the user's age via the input function. 
# The age and ticket prices should be as followed:
# age <= 13, price= $10.00
# age >= 14, price= $15.00
# age >= 25, price= $20.00
# age >= 55, price= $10.00    
 

# nested conditionals
# login system --> access your documents

# movie system
